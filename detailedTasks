Linkedin API
	We need two routes, ie we need to urls that will give us two pieces of data:
		1. User Information
			-We would like to enter a username and get back Linkedin's information about that user.
		2. User feeds
			-We would like to enter a username or id(from User information) and get back
			 the feed posts for that user.
			 
		3. We need to find out how to authorize our app.
			-look for API token, API secret, Consumer key...etc
		
		4. We need to find out if there a a ruby gem that makes it easier
			 to use the Linkedin API.



HTML
	We need html/css coded for:
		1. An "add followed account" form.
			-This will have just a submit button, a field for the username, and a field for the platform.
			-The field for the platform should probably be a dropdown.
		2. A user interface for "Tracked Platforms" on the user page that shows which platforms a user is tracking on.
		3. A user interface for "Tracked Accounts" on the user page that shows information about tracked accounts.
	
	No idea of how this looks. Run with it.
	
Signup/Login Form Components 
	We need the form components to be wired up to the rails backend.
		1. On submit the signup form should POST to /v1/user/ and for the login form  a POST to v1/sessions/. 
		2. The user should be returned as a json object.
		3. The page need to redirect to the userpage

Rails Route for "add followed account"
	1. Need followed_account controller
	2. Need new followed account route
