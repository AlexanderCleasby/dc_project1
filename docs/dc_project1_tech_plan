Plan Forward
1. Discuss Purpose of Application
   1. To provide automated aggregation of social media content.
   2. To provide a central location for viewing content.
   3. To provide access to source content from the application.
   4. To provide automatic notification of content.
   5. To aggregate content from multiple social media platforms.
2. Objectives
   1. Features
      1. Track urls
      2. Track user pages/posts/tweets/etc
      3. Post from app?
      4. Handling non text content: images,video,audio,docs, etc
      5. Desktop notifications
      6. Email notifications
      7. Text notifications
      8. Will content be searchable?
      9. Track content based on specific conditions: topic mentions, content type.
      10. Sharing of tracked pages/content? From within the app or delegate to source
      11. Will there be a “most popular tracked pages” for users to see?
   2. App design, ie  SPA, Mobile(native) App
   3. Data collected on user, pages?
3. Tech Requirements
   1. Backend API: Rails
   2. Frontend: React/React native/Bootstrap 4
   3. Database: PostgresSQL
      1. Need to think about how content will be saved, taking into account the possibility of two different users following the same content.
      2. How long will content be saved.
   4. Platforms to accommodate: FB, Twitter, Linkedin, Instagram, Pintrest, etc
   5. Omniauth
      1. Need to decide on how a user will integrate their accounts on other platforms and if they will.
   6. Testing: Rspec/Capybara/Cucumber/Mocha/etc
4. User Stories(As a user I can:)
   1. Create an account
      1. Devise vs custom? 
      2. A need for roles?
      3. Profile layout
   2. Log in/out
   3. Add urls/posts of public content I want to track to my account
   4. Remove urls/posts of public content I want to track from my account
   5. Set notification interval
   6. Set content aggregation interval
   7. Choose which platform content to display
   8. Set number of aggregation points
      1. We may choose to limit this as we like.
   9. Delete my account and data
   10. Remove tracked content
5. ToDo
   1. Front-end mockups/wireframe
      1. Breakdown component possibilities for React.js
      2. Color scheme 
   1. API research for social media platforms
      1. What can we track from their API
         1. Urls
         2. User activity
         3. Automation, ie webhooks vs service runners on our end
         4. API request number limitations
         5. Access rights/authorizations
            1. Will a user need to authorize our app to access the content via the API?
         6. Map out theoretical API calls from our app to get the data we need.
            1. Content (GET content json)
            2. Timestamp (GET content json)
            3. Link it to source (GET content source page)
         7. GraphQL?
   1. Stub out basic classes/models 
      1. Class for each platform? Can we abstract further?
      2. What data do we get from the user?
         1. User given
         2. Collected on user
         3. Collected on content
      3. What data do we get from API calls?
      4. What data do we present to the user?
      5. Formatting methods
      6. Content aggregation methods
      7. Keep in mind the resource routes for our own API
6. Nice to have
   1. Frontend representation(mockups, no code) in 2 weeks
      1. Everyone’s input
      2. Can use Photoshop, Balsamic or whatever mocking tools
   2. Platform API info for at least two in 2 weeks
   3. An app name in two weeks
   4. Features decided on for MVP in one week
7. Deployment
   1. Future Discussion
