Steps to get up and running with your own branch


1. Remove any locally downloaded copies of the repo from your machine.
	-delete or move to trash will suffice.
2. Go into your bitbucket account and clone the repo.
3. run `git checkout api`
4. run `git checkout -b  <newBranchName>`, name it whatever you like.


This will be your "working branch". Only commit and push code to this branch.
Never commit or push code to the "api" or "master" branches.

A process for development:

1. When starting a new day of work or after having not updated your working branch
	first run `git pull origin api`. This will pull in any changes from the api branch to 
	your working branch.

2. Commit often, `git add <fileName>`, `git commit -m "message"`, `git push origin <workingBranchName`.
	-You don't need to push every time you commit. You can wait until you are finished for the day unless someone
	else needs your changes.


Tyler will pull changes from everyones working branches as tasks are completed.
Please let me know if you ever have any git issues. Its not a problem and most things can be undone or we can 
just start over from the last known good commit and as a last resort we can start over completely.


To get the project running on your machine:

1. You need to have ruby 2.5, get it.
2. You need to have the latest version of node.js, get it.
   -I like Digital Ocean's tutorials for installing things.
3. Once you have ruby and node ready, cd into the root.
4. run bundle update.
5. run rake db:schema:load 
6. go into db/seeds.rb and change the email to your email, keep password the same. Its only for development.
7. run rake db:seed
8. run rails c and then User.first. copy the authentication_token.
9. paste the authentication token and the email you used in step 6 into `/client/src/App.js` line 36-39

headers: {
	'X-User-Email': '',
	'X-User-Token': ''
}a

10. run rake start and navigate to localhost:3001/v1/start_feed_lookup
